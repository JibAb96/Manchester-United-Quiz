## Design 

### Colour Scheme
The colors I used are based on the Manchester United brand. These colors include: #DA291C, aliceblue, #AA291C, black etc.

### Typography
I used a google font by the name of Sedan to give the website a sophisticated look. 

### Imagery
I went out of my way to find high quality background images which are relevant to the topic of the quiz and to improve the aesthetics of the page.
